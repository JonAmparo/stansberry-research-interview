      </p>
      <p class="pt-10">Dear Reader,</p>

      <p>
        A huge story is breaking in the financial world and it’s making some
        people extraordinarily wealthy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Three people have already become billionaires in less than 48 hours.
      </p>

      <p>
        It has nothing to do with cryptocurrencies, marijuana stocks, or penny
        stocks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead, a simple type of stock – which millions of investors have not
        been able to buy for the past 29 years – just started trading on a
        brand-new stock exchange some are calling the “New Nasdaq.”
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe literally millions of people could rush to open brokerage
        accounts to trade on the “New Nasdaq.”
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s because, on it’s very first day, 16 of the 25 stocks listed on
        this exchange doubled.
      </p>

      <p>One stock soared as high as 520% in just a few hours…</p>

      <p>
        And the <b>smallest</b> gain on this exchange was 84% in a single day.
      </p>

      <p>That’s more than 4x the year to date return of the S&amp;P 500.</p>

      <p>
        Teachers... mechanics... droves of retirees... and millions of folks
        who’ve never purchased a single stock in their lives will soon rush to
        buy shares on this new exchange.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m calling this “The Greatest Investing Opportunity of Our Lifetime”,
        but it’s only getting started.
      </p>

      <p>
        There’s a pipeline of another 100 stocks waiting to list on this
        exchange.
      </p>
      <p>I believe that number could soon jump to 1,000.</p>
      <p>
        And I’ve identified the #1 best stock to buy today to take advantage of
        this opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don’t have to open any special accounts or get permission to buy
        this stock. It’d take no more than a few minutes to buy in an ordinary
        brokerage account.
      </p>
      <p>My name is Dr. Steve Sjuggerud.</p>
      <p>
        I’m a former stock broker, mutual fund vice president, and hedge fund
        manager.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the last twenty years, I’ve written like this to people off Wall
        Street showing them how to make money in the stock market.
      </p>
      <p>
        But just recently I’ve focused all of my attention to spreading the word
        about the new opportunity I’ve been telling you about…
      </p>
      <p>
        I&#39;ve gone to great lengths to get this message in front of you...
      </p>
      <p>
        I filmed a documentary about it, which you can find right now on Amazon
        Prime.
      </p>

      />

      <p>I went to the New York Stock Exchange... and rang the closing bell.</p>

        alt="Picture of five men at the New York Stock Exchange"
      />

      <p>
        And I&#39;ve just returned from traveling over 16,000 miles to share
        what I believe is the biggest investment story in the world that nobody
        is telling.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2016 alone, it had more than double the number of IPOs as the NYSE.
      </p>

      <p>
        And the top four biggest companies in the world today are ALL listed on
        the NASDAQ.

        Who’s to say what the world would look like today if the NASDAQ didn't
        take a chance on companies like Apple and Amazon?
